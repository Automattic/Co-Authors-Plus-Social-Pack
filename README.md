Co-Authors-Plus-Social-Pack
===========================

Co-Authors Plus add-on pack with profile fields for popular social media services and the ability to allow attributing posts to their Authors when shared using Jetpack.

Easily save an Author’s social media information with their Guest Author profile, as well as attribute Tweets sent from the WordPress.com Sharing Tools to the author that wrote the post, simply by checking the appropriate box on their profile page.

Additionally, Co Authors Plus Social Pack allows marking the Author as a ‘Related’ account to be suggested by Twitter once a post has been shared, making it even easier for your site’s visitors to engage with your authors.

Since all fields are loaded with Guest Author objects, retrieving social media info is as easy as:

* $twitter_username = $guest_author-&gt;twitter;
* $google_plus      = $guest_author-&gt;google_plus;
* $facebook         = $guest_author-&gt;facebook;
